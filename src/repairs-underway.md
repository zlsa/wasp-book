Jase and I wait in the bright passenger airlock of the ship while
awaiting egress instructions from the ground controllers. The
passenger airlock is at the top of the ship, and we have to wait for
the ground computers to manipulate the passenger arm into place. The
_Wasp's_ airlock is starkly minimalist, as it should be; the floor
gently curves into the sidewalls and ceiling, and the front and back
doors are fifteen centimeters of carbon fiber weave. Air pressure is
no joke.

A dull metal-against-metal _clunk_ indicates that the passenger arm
has locked onto the airlock's outside rim; seconds later, a green
light on the panel flickers alive in front of me, indicating that the
lock is solid and the data connection is in place. I tap the
"equalize" button and step back from the air vents.

It takes about thirty seconds to equalize the interior and exterior
air pressure; there's a faint hiss as an air valve opens and the
outside air is allowed to enter the airlock through large vents on
opposite sides of the airlock. I reach forwards and pull on the outer
airlock door's long handle, and with a series of clicks, the door
slowly swings out.

The corridor in the passenger arm is about fifty feet long, with a
strip of blue-tinged lighting running along the left and right edges
of the ceiling. I step into it, aware of the slight wobble the arm has
relative to the ship. After all, we're about four hundred feet up
right now; some wobble is to be expected.

The double elevator doors, at the end of the corridor, slide open
smoothly as we approach. Brushed metal surrounds the rear glass wall
of the elevator cabin. Leaning forwards, I can see the coastline and
the edge of the city to the right, and far beneath me are the edges of
two other landing pads. My watch beeps, and I glance down at it. Our
customer has received word that we've landed and would like to inspect
their delivery, the message says. What's a good time?

I step into the elevator as Jase presses the "down" button; with a
smooth hum, the elevator begins to descend. I turn backwards and lean
against the metal wall, watching the _Wasp_ as we get lower and
lower. It seems to get larger and larger as we descend, its shiny
surface increasingly looking like a misplaced skyscraper, placed
incongruously on a landing pad instead of in the city. Glancing down,
I see the flap as it comes into view and try very hard to not
wince. It's pretty nasty; the grating of the landing pad is already
slick with what appears to be oil from the flap mechanism, and I can
see wires and hoses dangling limply from the remains of a
piston. Thankfully, there's no visible engine debris; do you know how
fucking much it costs to rebuild a spacecraft primary engine?

I hold onto the polished grab bar and reply to the customer's message.

    > On my way to the rendezvous point. ETA 30 minutes. Disembarking now.

As the elevator approaches the relative midpoint of the descent
(elevators begin their descent faster than they arrest it; 0.3Gs
sustained is fine but 1.7 would raise eyebrows), it begins to slow
down. My apparent weight jumps from 15kg to over 60kg. I watch as
Jase's knees almost buckle; he pulls himself up with the elevator's
grab bar, avoiding eye contact. It's his first time on a planet in
weeks, and he's evidently forgotten about gravity in the meantime.

The last fifty meters of the descent seems to take the longest. I stare
up at the _Wasp_; we're now totally dwarfed by it. The beautiful ship
is marred by the severe damage on the flap and the surrounding area. I
can see now that the entire flap is crooked; that means the _Wasp_
will need a full structural inspection of the tail and a new flap, at
the very least. There goes a couple million credits.

The view is cut short as the elevator plunges into darkness as it
descends below pad level into the concrete bunker. For a few seconds,
the only lighting is the blue-white accent lighting of the elevator,
until the soft warm light of the bunker shines through the elevator
cab. The elevator comes to a smooth stop, and the doors slide open.

We step out into the bunker, which is far more comfortable than the
name would suggest. The warm lighting, soft fuzzy carpet, and the
chairs surrounding the coffe table really make it seem like a cozy
home rather than a bomb shelter (because let's face it, if a ship's
engines malfunction during the landing burn, it's basically a bomb.)
Actually scratch that; the double blast doors at the far side of the
room definitely don't belong in a house.

The six tons of cargo we've carried halfway across the Orion-Cygnus
arm for the last two weeks are in the hold of the ship, safely
secured.

The mechanics are amazed. They say that they've never seen damage this
extensive on a ship before.
