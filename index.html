<h1 id="prologue">Prologue</h1>
<p>The spaceship blinked into existence sixteen thousand kilometers above the blue-gray surface of the planet. At first, it sat there silently; then, after a few minutes, the four mammoth engines slowly resumed their quiet hum, and the plasma thrusters at the nose and the tail thrust in short bursts to reorient the heavy ship. The jump it had just performed was much further than usual, and as a result, it took the ship’s full energy reserves to complete the jump.</p>
<p>The exterior, formerly smooth and white, was pockmarked with many gashes and gaping holes, and some of the plasma thrusters could only produce short, sputtering discharges. One of the engine housings had been cracked, and two of the aerodynamic fins at the tail were bent at odd angles. A row of scrapes ran the entire length of the right side, exposing the internal hoses and cables where the skin had been peeled back.</p>
<p>The orbit it had jumped into was highly elliptical; it was near the periapsis of its orbit, and would swing around the planet in an orbit with a three-month period. If the ship had been in better condition, it would be preparing for planetary entry by lowering its orbit. In its current condition, though, it couldn’t hope to survive the atmospheric entry to the surface in one piece; indeed, it was almost a miracle that it had completed the jump in the first place. Damage that extensive usually resulted in a scrap of the ship; it was simply too expensive and difficult to repair.</p>
<p>So the captain sent out a distress signal on the system-wide navcom network, and a few hours later, a smaller ship with red and white stripes painted on it approached from the distant planet. It approached the damaged ship, which opened a small door on its hull, through which a docking mechanism extended. The smaller ship maneuvered itself until it was next to the dock, then uncovered and extended its own. Hard contact between the two was confirmed at eight hours and fourteen minutes after the damaged ship had first jumped in.</p>
<p>The ships remained docked for three days; during this time, the damaged ship was stripped of valuable items, and its crew prepared to return to the planet. The ship would be tracked by radar; it would remain in its orbit for centuries. The orbit would be made public, and one of the myriad space salvage corporations would eventually separate the ship of every bit of valuable material it held.</p>
<p>After the rescue ship departed, the damaged ship remained alone for nearly a week; then, a massive ship jumped into the system, only a few hundred kilometers away from the empty, damaged ship. Its sharp, angular lines covered up a massive powerplant and engine, and the double slots at the front were used for launching close-range attack drones. It was an offensive battleship, the likes of which only the UASF could design or afford. Such a ship would usually be detected by system scans the moment it jumped in; however, this ship was protected by an advanced visual and radio shield that warped space around it. As long as the shield remained active, the ship would be undetectable by all but the most advanced scanners.</p>
<p>Over the next two days, it slowly approached the damaged ship; then, in the span of only a few minutes, the shield was disabled, the damaged ship was pulled in by drones, and the battleship jumped out with the damaged ship on board.</p>
<p>The dramatic gravitic ripple was reported mere minutes later on the planet and on its three space stations; speculation abounded as to the cause. After the scanners had stopped going haywire, it was noticed that the damaged ship was gone. Nuclear thermal runaway in ship powerplants was not unheard of, but it was rare; however, that it would happen to such a badly damaged ship was not a surprise. The event was quickly forgotten.</p>
<p>The last member of the damaged ship’s crew had been discharged from the hospital the day of the event. None of them had been heard from since.</p>

<h1 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h1>
<p>The <em>Wasp</em>’s four aerodynamic drag flaps deploy at four hundred and fifty kilometers above the surface. The flaps protect the delicate engines during the harsh atmospheric entry, as well as decreasing terminal velocity once in the soup of the lower atmosphere. The building-sized spacecraft, gleaming white in the yellow glow of the distant sun, contains four crew and three hundred tons of out-of-system cargo. Some of it is legal, too.</p>
<p>The bridge—if a two-man cockpit can be called that—displays the trajectory and surroundings of the ship, as well as the status of its systems. Instead of the inches-thick diamond windshield used in earlier models, the <em>Wasp</em> has a fully digital bridge. Sensors mounted on the vehicle relay data to the ship’s computer core, and it renders the environment and displays it on window-sized display panels. The <em>Wasp</em> is capable of flying itself in nearly any condition; like all modern ships, the human crew is aboard only as a precaution.</p>
<p>The <em>Wasp</em> was built only three years ago, in 3402; and as such, it was a highly advanced, state-of-the-art spaceship, capable of both interstellar jumps and atmospheric entry and landing. In a pinch, it could jump a cumulative 30 light years per day.</p>
<p>This last attribute was the reason its crew had chosen the <em>Wasp</em>. The manufacturer had only produced a dozen Athro-class ships before one had gone missing, along with its crew and single passenger, the leader of the twelve member systems of the Interplanetary Alliance. The legal proceedings mired the company, and they were shuttered within months. As the fastest ship in the galaxy, it made a good ship for barely-legal cargo. Plus, the ship looked really cool.</p>
<hr />
<p>As the ship began encountering the wispy tendrils of the upper atmosphere, the tail shield glows orange, then red, then white. The drag flaps, held open with pairs of massive electromagnetic pistons, creak under the immense force as the white-hot plasma pushes them back. Inside, the seat restraints begin to tighten up as the G-force gradually increases; as the shaking becomes more pronounced, the plasma thrusters engag, aligning the vehicle and keeping it traveling down the center of the entry corridor.</p>
<p>At one hundred and fifteen kilometers in altitude and pulling nearly four gees, one of the pistons on the flaps snaps. Thick electrical cables whip around in the near-vacuum behind the flap; chunks of metal and ceramic fly about crazily. The flap, now held by only a single piston, begins to slowly retract towards the vehicle. The red-hot plasma streams past the edges of the flap, approaching the lip of the engine the flap was designed to protect.</p>
<p>Inside, alarms begin to go off.</p>
<hr />
<p>“Port side engine A is heating up past nominal,” called out Jase as the master caution alerts go off and the gentle blue glow of the displays shifts to orange. “I’m also seeing reduced aero pressure in the ventral flap.” Out of the corner of my eye, I see him wave his hand over the control panels in front of him, his hand glowing orange from the alerts on the display. “It looks like we’ve got a partially retracted number three flap. I’ll bring up the partial flap failure checklist.”</p>
<p>“Go right ahead,” I reply, watching the flight displays. I can see from the display that entry guidance is still engaged despite one of the four aero flaps not being fully deployed; the plasma thrusters on the nose can easily overcome a failed flap and keep the ship in the entry corridor. The engines, on the other hand… they’re not that good at operating after ingesting debris, especially if the debris was melted off of the engine itself in the first place. If an engine doesn’t work, we can still land, probably; if another engine fails during the landing burn, we’re dead meat. Admittedly, engine failures are incredibly unlikely, but it beats the alternative.</p>
<p>The standard entry abort procedure dictates running the engines at max thrust with the flaps closed during reentry, then ditching in an ocean. Best case, it destroys all four engines and the entire tail end of the ship; worst case, everybody dies anyway when the engines through and we’re still in the upper atmosphere. Needless to say, I’d prefer avoiding those fates.</p>
<p>“Okay, first off,” Jase begins. “Confirm reactor efficiency both above 95%.”</p>
<p>I look up at the overhead panel, where most of the systems controls are. Both reactors are operating at below 15% capacity and running at 98% efficiency; they’re also well within acceptable temperatures. “Yup, both good.”</p>
<p>“Fuel cells to AUTO.”</p>
<p>All six fuel cell banks are on auto; none of them show any failures. “Yup, all green.”</p>
<p>“Uh, check the power levels to the flaps.”</p>
<p>I glance at the four green bars, each of them full. “All at 100%.”</p>
<p>“Okay, so it’s got to be a mechanical issue, then. What’s the temperature increase rate on the flap?”</p>
<p>“I’m seeing thirty per second. We’ll be overstressing the number one engine a bit, but we should make it to the surface just fine.”</p>
<p>He consults the procedures for the ship. “Uh, you’re not gonna like this,” he says, frowning. “They say thirty five per second is the abort temp. Something to do with runaway systems failure.” He looks up from the panel and watches me, waiting for my reaction.</p>
<p>I consider an entry abort for a fraction of a second, then discard the idea. We’re not technically above the trigger temperature increase yet, and the checklists and procedures were written with ass-covering in mind. Plus, an entry abort would destroy the ship and we’d lose the cargo, and that’s on top of the fines we’d get hit with if the ship cratered anywhere remotely habitable.</p>
<p>“We’ll stay with it,” I tell him. “If we hit fourty, we’ll abort.” He nods in assent, then continues to monitor the systems.</p>
